# Color Game
## An interactive musical memory game.

The idea behind "Color-Game" is to provide an interactive exercise that will test the users memory.  
The game has both a visual component and an auditory component.
Eight colorful buttons are presented to the user after they begin the game. Each of these buttons corresponds to a note on the major scale.  
These buttons will display a pattern to the user that they must then reproduce by clicking the buttons in the right order.
The buttons themselves are musical, and play the notes as the user presses them.   
The pattern is not differnent each time , it builds upon the previous pattern with each "round" of the game. I decided that this was the most satisfying way  to present the patterns to the user , as it is easy to remember patterns that are reoccuring.  
If the user reproduces the pattern that was presented , then they are awarded a point , and the game progesses to the next round. 
When the user inevitably makes a mistake (unless of course you are rain man), the game will display a score at the end.  

This game is intended for anyone looking for a light memory exercise to improve their memory and pattern recognition skills. The idea is that the user will challenge themselves to beat the previous score that they have gotten.
